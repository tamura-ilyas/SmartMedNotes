# *SmartMedNotes*

*SmartMedNotes* is a *Generative AI-powered clinical documentation system* that answers orthopedic-related queries and automates clinical documentation using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

## *Features*

- *Frontend:* Built using *Vite + Tailwind CSS* for a fast and responsive UI.
- *Backend:* Developed using *Python Flask*, ensuring efficient query processing and model integration.
- *Model:* Fine-tuned *microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct* for generating accurate medical responses.
- *Embeddings:* Utilizes *sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2* for optimized information retrieval.
- *Technique:* Implements *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* for improved contextual accuracy.
- *Database:* Uses *Firebase* for storing user queries and relevant data.
- *Deployment:*
  - *Frontend:* Hosted on *Vercel* for seamless accessibility.
  - *Backend:* Deployed on *Hugging Face* for reliable API handling.
## *Technologies*
-	*Python & Flask:* Used for backend API development and server-side logic.
-	*Hugging Face Spaces:* Platform for deploying the backend, including the fine-tuned model and retrieval system.
-	*FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):* Utilized for efficient vector search and similarity retrieval.
-	*Microsoft/Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct:* Fine-tuned model for generating responses based on orthopedic queries.
-	*Sentence-Transformers/All-MiniLM-L6-V2:* Used for embedding generation in the retrieval process.
